**Start**: To begin the interactive Mandelbrot visualization, the file should be executed in the terminal using: "python mandelbrot-zoomable.py".

**Operation**: Once the application is started, you can zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. Scrolling up zooms in, while scrolling down zooms out. It's advised to zoom in on the edges of the figure, since the most intresting figures can be found there.

**Exit**: To exit the application, right-click the mouse.

**Adjustments**: Variables can be modified as described within the code itself.
